## Welcome to CryptMatrix :milky_way:

This repository contains the codebase for our recent research on privacy-preserving computation and data integrity protection based on secure multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proof. We are committed to continuously open-sourcing our work and welcome collaborations, forks, and discussions!
